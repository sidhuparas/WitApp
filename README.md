# WitApp

## What is it?

It's an Android application developed using React Native which extracts the user intent from a text input. User will need to type some specific query and the app will display its the user intention.

At this time, we accept some specific category of inputs only.

#### Categories:

* Weather
* Distance
* Directions
* Time Taken

#### Examples:

* How much time will it take to travel from Delhi to Mumbai?
* Will it be cold tomorrow?
* Give me directions from New York to London
* How far is Kolkata from Nagpur?

NOTE: Question Mark (?) is optional.

##How it works?
